## ❓  Why Join Telegram ?

> We currently only have one premium account, so to prevent this account from being patched by the Quill Bot a powerful script is running behind the scenes which logs in the Quill Bot account in a virtual browser and keeps monitoring with the Quill Bot detection system. Quill Bot is extremely against account sharing, and when an account is shared Quill Bot detection system detects the account and they patch those accounts that are being shared.


> When the quill bot detection system is activated, the server logs itself out of the virtual browser, generates a new sessions token that is modified from the actual session, and invalidates the existing ones. As a result, quill bot is unable to recognize the account and the browser. The server then generates a new secret token, which is required when you open quillbot, and upon entering it, your extension will once more be synced to the server with new session token, to get that code each time it is modified We update on Telegram as soon as something changes.
